# MD.emu #

The code of MD.emu is copyright 2011 Robert Broglia.

This project is simply an Xcode project for it to allow easy
installation on non-jailbroken iOS devices. It also serves as a
Git mirror of the codebase.

[MD.emu][1] is an Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Master System/Mark III 
emulator written in C++ for Android, iOS, and WebOS. It uses the
emulation backend from [Genesis Plus][3] ([GX][4]) and is built on top of
the [Imagine][5] engine. The source is released under the [GPLv3][2] license.

### Usage ###

1. Install the app using Xcode (tested with 4.2 and 4.3).
2. Deploy ROMs using iTunes file sharing.
3. When using iCade / iControlPad, you need to activate that in the
settings of the app.
4. On iPhone 4S or iPad 2 you can of course use AirPlay mirroring to
play on your TV.
5. Enjoy!
